    "Define the centre coordinate of the map. This does not necessarily need to be the centre of the las file, but that is an obvious choice. To find this coordinate, open the las file and calculate the range of the Northings and Eastings, which is usually 1000 or 2000 meters for a typical LiDAR tile. Divide the range by 2 and add that value to the value of the Left extent bound and also to the Bottom extent bound. (Usually LiDAR tiles are square, so you can safely add the same value to the lower bounds of the extent, but you may need to adjust this approach.) \n",
    "\n",
    "The Minetest map that you produce is not necessarily going to be the same extent as the LiDAR tile, so you can place the map centre anywhere you want within the las extent. However, you must ensure that this coordinate is at least `size/2` distance from the true edge of the las extent so that you actually build a full map. This coordinate is also used as the starting place for the player."

    "## Map size\n",
    "Specify the `size` of the output Minetest map. This is the width and length of the map in blocks. Each block corresponds to 1 meter in the point cloud. Thus, this dimension is what will be used to clip a square extent of `size*size` area from the las file centred at `coord`. Increasing this value does not produce smaller voxels, but instead increases the extent of the Minetest map because the size of blocks in Minetest is fixed. Each incremental value of `size` results in a squared number of new positions to be created and potentially many more blocks, so be careful about creating large maps as they can take long to process and may crash Minetest when loaded. Testing on my Intel i9-10885H yielded about 30 minutes to run a complex 300x300 urban map. You can also try running without the inverse distance weighting interpolation first to see if holes might be a problem in your las. Comment lines 40-56 in the `get_blocks()` function to turn off the interpolation."

    "`get_points()` applies an `x,y` mask to the point cloud defined by the `size` variable above and then retrieves the `x,y,z` coordinates of all points and rescales the `xy` values to `0 to size` and the `z` values to `0 to max(z)`. Normally, we divide the units of the point cloud by 100 to convert from centimeters to meters, which is approximately what is used by Minetest. You can modify this parameter by choosing any value for `scale`:\n",
    "- `scale < 1` causes the Minetest world to expand relative to the player (player shrinks)\n",
    "- `scale = 1` is approximately 1:1 real-world scale\n",

    "\n",
    "**Note that if you choose any value other than 1 you will be modifying the scale of the Minetest map (i.e., creating more or fewer voxels relative to the player's perspective).** This parameter does not modify the map `size`. If `scale < 1`, then more voxels are created (point cloud expands *beyond* the map) and any in excess of `size` are dropped and will not be mapped. If `scale > 1`, then fewer voxels are created (point cloud shrinks *within* the map) within the map and some areas of the map `size` may not be used at all. Modifying `scale` should only be used to explore the point cloud data and visualize how different vozel sizes might impact how features might be represented differently."

If you want to experiment with different configurations, find a good starting location (i.e., `coord`) with some variety and set the map `size` to a smaller value (e.g., between 20 and 50) so that you can quickly try out different block types. You can change the top layer of the ground by specifying an `Itemstring` for `top_layer_of_ground_block`. You must specify at least the first 3 classes in order to generate the terrain. You can specify more classes, but any excess classes specified that are not classified in the las file will be ignored and you will see a warning message."

    "`get_blocks()` uses `height`, `classification`, and `zyx` to build the `blocks.csv` file that is then used by the [csv2terrain](https://github.com/quantumjim/csv2terrain/blob/master/README.md) Minetest mod to create the map in Minetest. One important role of this function is to fill any \"holes\" that might exist in the terrain. For example, ground returns may be incorrectly classified or the ground may be obstructed by a surface feature. In both of these cases, there will be a \"hole\" in the map because there are no known `z` height values at the given `x,y`. Therefore, inverse distance weighting interpolation is applied to the `x,y` locations that need an interpolated `z` value. Through testing, I have found that `knn=5` nearest neighbours is sufficient, but you can also select any value for `k` below depending on the nature of your input LiDAR point cloud and the classified ground returns."

There is a vertical threshold that must be exceeded before a stem is mapped.

    "1. Make sure that you have installed the `csv2terrain` mod in Minetest. See instructions above for download and installation.\n",
    "2. Once the `blocks.csv` file has been generated, copy the csv file to the `\\Minetest\\mods\\csv2terrain\\`. Then, run Minetest and create a new world. Ensure that the `Mapgen` mode is set to `singlenode`, which will generate an empty world with only air blocks (called [\"nodes\"](https://wiki.minetest.net/Games/Minetest_Game/Nodes) in Minetest). You do not need to provide a seed and make sure `Minetest game` is selected under `Game`. Press the `Create` button to generate the world.\n",
    "3. Once you are redirected back to the main menu, select your world from the `Select World:` menu. For the best experience, I suggest toggling on `Creative Mode` and toggling off `Enable Damage`. Click the `Select Mods` button and here you should see the `csv2terrain` mod if it was installed correctly. Double-click `csv2terrain` and the text will turn green if it has been enabled properly. Press the `Save` button.\n",
    "4. Click the `Play Game` button. The player should be falling through the air. Press the `/` key to bring up the console. Type `ltbv` (short for: Let There Be Voxels). Be patient as the Minetest world is being generated from the blocks.csv file. If all goes well, you should land on top of the newly built terrain and you can start navigating in the approximate real-life experience using the arrow keys (or `wasd` keys) and `spacebar` to jump.\n",

    "## Tips and controls\n",
    "- Press the `/` key and type `grant singleplayer all` into the console to give the player all game privileges.\n",
    "- Press the `k` key (default) to enable flying, then press the `spacebar` key to fly up and press `shift` to fly down. Press the `k` key again to disable flying.\n",
    "- Press the `j` key (default) to enable fast mode, which allows you to move/fly quickly around the world and change perspectives. Press the `j` key again to disable fast mode.\n",
    "- Press the `/` key and type `time 6000` to change the time of day to 6AM causing the Sun to rise. Increments of 1000 are equivalent to hours in 24-hour time (e.g., 18000 is 6PM).\n",
    "- Press the `I` key to access the inventory of blocks (nodes) in creative mode. Drag blocks into your inventory space at the bottom. `Right-click` on your mouse (default) to place blocks. `Left-click` on your mouse (default) to mine or remove blocks. Press `B` and `N` keys to move left and right, respectively, in your hotbar inventory of blocks.\n",
    "- Cardinal directions are true in the Minetest world: North in the Minetest world is true Nouth and the Minetest Sun rises in the true East and sets in the true West."
