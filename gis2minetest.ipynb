    "- [Download Minetest](https://www.minetest.net/downloads/). To install, simply extract the contents somewhere that you have read/write access to on your computer (e.g., your user directory on Windows `C:\\Users\\YourUsername\\minetest\\`). Navigate to the `bin` folder, find the `minetest.exe` executable, right-click it and create a shortcut on your desktop or taskbar, then double-click the shortcut to run Minetest.\n",
    "- [Download the csv2terrain mod](https://github.com/pauldpickell/gis2minetest) distributed with this repository. To install, simply extract the contents into your `mods` folder within your Minetest directory. For example, `C:\\Users\\YourUsername\\minetest\\mods\\`. Ensure that the folder is renamed `csv2terrain`. Run Minetest and create a new world with any options then press the `Select Mods` button and you should see `csv2terrain` listed there if the installation was done correctly.\n",

    "## Map centre\n",
    "Define the centre coordinate of the map. This does not necessarily need to be the centre of the las file, but that is an obvious choice. To find this coordinate, open the las file and calculate the range of the Northings and Eastings, which is usually 1000 or 2000 meters for a typical LiDAR tile. Divide the range by 2 and add that value to the value of the Left extent bound and also to the Bottom extent bound. (Usually LiDAR tiles are square, so you can safely add the same value to the lower bounds of the extent, but you may need to adjust this approach.) \n",
    "\n",
    "The Minetest world that you produce is not necessarily going to be the same extent as the LiDAR tile, so you can place the map centre anywhere you want within the las extent. However, you must ensure that this coordinate is at least `size/2` distance from the true edge of the las extent so that you actually build a full map. This coordinate is also used as the starting place for the player."

    "## Map size\n",
    "Specify the `size` of the output Minetest map. This is the width and length of the map in blocks. Each block corresponds to 1 meter in the point cloud. Thus, this dimension is what will be used to clip a square extent of `size*size` area from the las file centred at `coord`. Increasing this value does not produce smaller voxels, but instead increases the extent of the Minetest map because the size of blocks in Minetest is fixed. Each incremental value of `size` results in a squared number of new positions to be created and potentially many more blocks, so be careful about creating large maps as they can take long to process and may crash Minetest when loaded."

    "## Load and preprocess Open Street Maps data\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case that `visualize = 'all'`, a query will be sent to download some Open Street Maps data in your area of interest. Open Street Maps data are retrieved using the [Overpass API](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API). Thus, if you expect to use Open Street Maps data, you must be connected to the internet. Since we may not know exactly what types of features lay within the extent of a given point cloud, we will just query the API to return all features that fall within a bounding box defined by our map `size` and point cloud `coord`. The Overpass API uses geographic coordinates (i.e., latitude and longitude), but the coordinates of las files are typically in a projected coordinate system like Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM). Thus, we need to convert from UTM coordinates to geographic coordinates in order to send a bounding box to the Overpass API to retrieve the correct Open Street Maps data. It is remarkably challenging to retrieve the spatial reference system from a las file, so the parameter `westernLongitudeDecimalDegrees` is used to quickly lookup and apply the right UTM zone using the western-most Longitude for your area of interest in decimal degrees. Once the bounding box is passed to the Overpass API, an XML file is returned and saved to your computer that is then parsed to extract specific features. You can specify block types for different features, which is explained in more detail below."

    "`get_points()` applies an `x,y` mask to the point cloud defined by the `size` variable above and then retrieves the `x,y,z` coordinates of all points and rescales the `xy` values to `0 to size` and the `z` values to `0 to max(z)`. Normally, we divide the units of the point cloud by 100 to convert from centimeters to meters, which is approximately what is used by Minetest. You can modify this parameter by choosing any value for `scale`:\n",
    "- `scale < 1` causes the Minetest world to expand relative to the player (player shrinks)\n",
    "- `scale = 1` is approximately 1:1 real-world scale\n",
    "- `scale > 1` causes the Minetest world to shrink relative to the player (player expands)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note that if you choose any value other than 1 you will be modifying the scale of the Minetest map (i.e., creating more or fewer voxels relative to the player's perspective).** This parameter does not modify the map `size`. If `scale < 1`, then more voxels are created (point cloud expands *beyond* the map) and any in excess of `size` are dropped and will not be mapped. If `scale > 1`, then fewer voxels are created (point cloud shrinks *within* the map) within the map and some areas of the map `size` may not be used at all. Modifying `scale` should only be used to explore the point cloud data and visualize how different vozel sizes might impact how features might be represented differently."

When you find a block type you want to use, enter the `Itemstring` for the block that corresponds to the classification value you want to associate it with. The block types below offer nice contrast between vegetation types, buildings and the ground. If you want to experiment with different configurations, find a good starting location (i.e., `coord`) with some variety and set the map `size` to a smaller value (e.g., between 20 and 50) so that you can quickly try out different block types. You can change the top layer of the ground by specifying an `Itemstring` for `top_layer_of_ground_block`. You must specify at least the first 3 classes in order to generate the terrain. You can specify more classes, but any excess classes specified that are not classified in the las file will be ignored and you will see a warning message.\n",

Any other block type will crash Minetest (i.e., `doors:`, `flowers:`, `fireflies:`, `tnt:`, `vessels:`, etc). Wool can be a useful block type because it provides a range of colours to work with. To invoke a wool block colour, simply name the colour in the block type (e.g., `cyan`)."

    "Many of these options are important for controlling how Open Street Maps is used to render urban worlds. `street_block` is the block type used to paint the streets. `obsidian` is a good choice, offering nice contrast against buildings and vegetation. As well, you have the option to add a slab block type on top of the terrain. Slab blocks are only one-half the height of a normal block, so this can give the impression of a curb raised above the street level. If `add_sidewalk_slab = 1`, then a slab block will be added to the terrain height with `top_layer_of_ground_block` still present underneath the slab.\n",

    "## Build and interpolate terrain from LiDAR\n",
    "`get_blocks()` uses `height`, `classification`, and `zyxc` to build the `blocks.csv` file that is then used by the [csv2terrain](https://github.com/quantumjim/csv2terrain/blob/master/README.md) Minetest mod to create the map in Minetest. One important role of this function is to fill any \"holes\" that might exist in the terrain. For example, ground returns may be incorrectly classified or the ground may be obstructed by a surface feature. In both of these cases, there will be a \"hole\" in the map because there are no known `z` height values at the given `x,y`. Therefore, inverse distance weighting interpolation is applied to the `x,y` locations that need an interpolated `z` value. Through testing, I have found that `knn=5` nearest neighbours is sufficient, but you can also select any value for `k` below depending on the nature of your input LiDAR point cloud and the classified ground returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function also creates all other classified blocks, including the identification and placement of tree stems and forest canopy. In order to identify the tree stem locations, a local maximum filter is applied to the normalized heights of the canopy (class=5; high vegetation): `canopy elevation - terrain elevation = tree height`. There is a vertical threshold that must be exceeded before a stem is mapped. Since the stem mapping can be sensitive to the type, age, and structure of the forest, the variable `tree_height_percentile` is provided below to control the minimum height of the top of the tree canopy before it may be mapped as a standalone stem. Use `tree_height_percentile = 50` for the median.\n",
