# gis2minetest
A python notebook for converting classified LiDAR las/laz files into [Minetest](https://www.minetest.net/downloads/) worlds.

## Updates
October 31, 2021: added additional support for mapping tree stems and differentiating canopy structure (see Malcolm Knapp Research Forest screenshots below).

## Sample Minetest Worlds
Two prefabricated Minetest worlds are included. Extract the folder contents to your `~\Minetest\worlds\` directory and then start Minetest to load the worlds.

## Screenshots
(The worlds are flipped on the y-axis before I squashed that bug)
