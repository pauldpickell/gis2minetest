# gis2minetest
A python notebook for converting classified LiDAR las/laz files into [Minetest](https://www.minetest.net/downloads/) worlds.

## Updates
October 31, 2021: added additional support for mapping tree stems and differentiating canopy structure (see Malcolm Knapp Research Forest screenshots below).

## Sample Minetest Worlds
Two prefabricated Minetest worlds are included. Extract the folder contents to your `~\Minetest\worlds\` directory and then start Minetest to load the worlds.

## Screenshots
(The worlds are flipped on the y-axis before I squashed that bug)

## Malcolm Knapp Research Forest, British Columbia, Canada
New feature supports mapping tree stems and differentiating canopy structure

Trees with different heights are more apparent

Retention trees have very well defined canopies within the harvest block and stem locations are likely accurate

Shading under the canopy is now much more apparent (time is 12PM noon)
